_This post covers the same material as [my !!Con 2024
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0ZLCHHku6U), for which the slides are
[here](https://vaibhavsagar.com/presentations/sat-solvers/)._

What are SAT solvers, and how are they useful? Let's start by briefly touching on
[NP-complete problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness)!

# NP-complete problems

NP-complete problems are [decision
problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem), i.e. the solution to
them is "yes" or "no". When these solutions exist, they can be verified in
[polynomial
time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Polynomial_time), but we
don't know how to find solutions in polynomial time, or even if this is
possible at all (this is the [P versus NP
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem)). An important
characteristic of NP-complete problems is that any NP-complete problem can be
reduced to any other NP-complete problem. Examples of NP-complete problems include:

- [Knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem)
- [Travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)
- [Subset sum problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem)
- [Graph colouring problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring)
- [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)
- [Boolean satisfiability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem)

We're specifically interested in the boolean satisfiability problem.

## Boolean satisfiability problem

One definition of the boolean satisfiability problem is

> Given a propositional logic formula, can we assign truth values to each
  variable such that the formula is satisfied?

When working with these formulas, we commonly express them in [Conjunctive
normal form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form) as
a conjunction (ANDed together) of clauses that consist of a series of
disjunctions (ORed together) of literals, e.g.

$$(x \vee y \vee z) \wedge (x \vee \neg y) \wedge (\neg y \vee \neg x) \wedge (\neg z)$$

With this context, I can finally tell you what SAT solvers are!

# SAT solvers

SAT solvers are programs that solve boolean satisfiability problems by
providing satisfying assignments (when they exist)! In other words, they are
programs for solving NP-complete problems expressed as instances of the boolean
satisfiability problem(!!)

# Sudoku

To demonstrate how this works in practice, let's look at how to *reduce* Sudoku
to a Boolean satisfiability problem.

The rules of Sudoku are as follows:

- Each cell contains exactly one digit
- Each digit occurs once per row
- Each digit occurs once per column
- Each digit occurs once per sub-grid
- The solution must use the filled-in cells

A useful insight is that we can use $n$ boolean variables to represent each
digit when we add the constraint that at most one of those variables can be
true.

Now we can express those rules in propositional logic:

## Each cell has at least one value

$$\displaylines{
\definecolor{comment}{RGB}{161,161,180}
{\color{comment}\textit{\small{row 1, column 1 is one of 1,2,...9}}} \\
(x_{1,1,1} \vee x_{1,1,2} \vee \dots \vee x_{1,1,9}) \wedge \\
{\color{comment}\textit{\small{row 1, column 2 is one of 1,2,...9}}} \\
(x_{1,2,1} \vee x_{1,2,2} \vee \dots \vee x_{1,2,9}) \wedge \\
\dots \\
{\color{comment}\textit{\small{row 9, column 9 is one of 1,2,...9}}} \\
(x_{9,9,1} \vee x_{9,9,2} \vee \dots \vee x_{9,9,9})
}$$

## Each cell has at most one value

$$\displaylines{
\definecolor{comment}{RGB}{161,161,180}
{\color{comment}\textit{\small{row 1, column 1 is not both 1 and 2}}} \\
(\neg x_{1,1,1} \vee \neg x_{1,1,2}) \wedge \\
{\color{comment}\textit{\small{row 1, column 1 is not both 1 and 3}}} \\
(\neg x_{1,1,1} \vee \neg x_{1,1,3}) \wedge \\
 \dots \\
{\color{comment}\textit{\small{row 9, column 9 is not both 8 and 9}}} \\
(\neg x_{9,9,8} \vee \neg x_{9,9,9})}$$

## Each row has all values

$$\displaylines{
\definecolor{comment}{RGB}{161,161,180}
{\color{comment}\textit{\small{row 1 has a 1}}} \\
(x_{1,1,1} \vee x_{1,2,1} \vee \dots \vee x_{1,9,1}) \wedge \\
{\color{comment}\textit{\small{row 1 has a 2}}} \\
(x_{1,1,2} \vee x_{1,2,2} \vee \dots \vee x_{1,9,9}) \wedge \\
\dots \\
{\color{comment}\textit{\small{row 9 has a 9}}} \\
(x_{9,1,9} \vee x_{9,2,9} \vee \dots \vee x_{9,9,9})}$$

## Each column has all values

$$\displaylines{
\definecolor{comment}{RGB}{161,161,180}
{\color{comment}\textit{\small{column 1 has a 1}}} \\
(x_{1,1,1} \vee x_{2,1,1} \vee \dots \vee x_{9,1,1}) \wedge \\
{\color{comment}\textit{\small{column 1 has a 2}}} \\
(x_{1,1,2} \vee x_{2,1,2} \vee \dots \vee x_{9,1,2}) \wedge \\
\dots \\
{\color{comment}\textit{\small{column 9 has a 9}}} \\
(x_{1,9,9} \vee x_{2,9,9} \vee \dots \vee x_{9,9,9})}$$

## Each sub-grid has all values

$$\displaylines{
\definecolor{comment}{RGB}{161,161,180}
{\color{comment}\textit{\small{sub-grid 1 has a 1}}} \\
(x_{1,1,1} \vee x_{1,2,1} \vee \dots \vee x_{3,3,1}) \wedge \\
{\color{comment}\textit{\small{sub-grid 1 has a 2}}} \\
(x_{1,1,2} \vee x_{1,2,2} \vee \dots \vee x_{3,3,2}) \wedge \\
\dots \\
{\color{comment}\textit{\small{sub-grid 9 has a 9}}} \\
(x_{7,7,9} \vee x_{7,8,9} \vee \dots \vee x_{9,9,9})}$$

## The solution must use the filled-in cells

This looks like

$$\displaylines{
x_{1,1,5} \wedge x_{1,2,3} \wedge x_{1,5,7} \wedge \\
x_{2,1,6} \wedge x_{2,4,1} \wedge x_{2,5,9} \wedge x_{2,6,5} \wedge \\
\dots \\
x_{9,5,8} \wedge x_{9,8,7} \wedge x_{9,9,9}}$$

## Solving

To solve this Sudoku (or indeed any NP-complete problem that we have expressed
as a Boolean satisfiability problem), all we need to do is provide the
resulting propositional logic formula as input to a SAT solver!

How do these marvellous programs work?

# DPLL

One algorithm is known as DPLL. To explain how it works, let's look at an
example. Not so coincidentally, this is the same propositional logic formula
from earlier! At the beginning, we don't know the values of $x$, $y$, or $z$.

$$(x \vee y \vee z) \wedge (x \vee \neg y) \wedge (\neg y \vee \neg x) \wedge (\neg z)$$

$x$: ðŸ¤·<br>
$y$: ðŸ¤·<br>
$z$: ðŸ¤·<br>

We begin by picking a variable and assigning it a truth value, preferring unit
clauses (clauses with a single literal). In this case, let's set $z$ to $False$.
Now we can perform [unit
propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_propagation).

## Unit propagation

When performing unit propagation, we assign the appropriate truth value to
a literal, which is obvious when it occurs in a unit clause. Then we remove all
clauses that are satisfied, since we don't need to consider them going forward.
Next we remove the literal where it is $False$, since it cannot contribute to
that clause being satisfied.

$$(x \vee y \vee \cancel{{\color{red} z}}) \wedge (x \vee \neg y) \wedge (\neg y \vee \neg x) \wedge \cancel{{\color{green} (\neg z)}}$$

$x$: ðŸ¤·<br>
$y$: ðŸ¤·<br>
$z$: `False`<br>

Next we pick another variable and continue. Let's set $y$ to $True$.

$$\cancel{{\color{green}(x \vee y \vee z)}} \wedge (x \vee \cancel{{\color{red} \neg y}}) \wedge (\cancel{{\color{red} \neg y}} \vee \neg x) \wedge \cancel{{\color{green}(\neg z)}}$$

$x$: ðŸ¤·<br>
$y$: `True`<br>
$z$: `False`<br>

Unfortunately, we now have a conflict, since two of the remaining clauses are $x$ and $\neg x$.

$$\cancel{{\color{green}(x \vee y \vee z)}} \wedge ({\color{blue} x} \vee \cancel{{\color{red} \neg y}}) \wedge (\cancel{{\color{red} \neg y}} \vee {\color{blue}\neg x}) \wedge \cancel{{\color{green}(\neg z)}}$$

$x$: ðŸ¤·<br>
$y$: `True`<br>
$z$: `False`<br>

The only appropriate thing to do here is backtrack, so we undo our previous assignment and try the other truth value, setting $y$ to $False$.

$$(x \vee \cancel{{\color{red} y}} \vee \cancel{{\color{red} z}}) \wedge \cancel{{\color{green}(x \vee \neg y)}} \wedge \cancel{{\color{green} (\neg y \vee \neg x)}} \wedge \cancel{{\color{green} (\neg z)}}$$

$x$: ðŸ¤·<br>
$y$: `False`<br>
$z$: `False`<br>

Now we can perform [pure literal elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm#The_algorithm).

## Pure literal elimination

When literals involving a variable in a propositional logic formula are either
always $True$ ($x$) or always $False$ ($\neg x$), then these are called _pure_
literals, and it's obvious what truth value to assign to them. In this case we set $x$ to $True$.

$$\cancel{{\color{green}(x \vee y \vee z)}} \wedge \cancel{{\color{green}(x \vee \neg y)}} \wedge \cancel{{\color{green} (\neg y \vee \neg x)}} \wedge \cancel{{\color{green} (\neg z)}}$$

$x$: `True`<br>
$y$: `False`<br>
$z$: `False`<br>

And that's DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland)!

## Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland

Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland is exhaustive backtracking search with unit
propagation and pure literal elimination. Although it works reasonably well for
small numbers of clauses, it has a tendency to repeatedly run into the same
conflicts, and when it does it only backtracks one level at a time. It would be
great to somehow remember and learn from these conflicts when we encounter
them, so we can scale up to more complex problems. Does such an algorithm
exist? It does.

# CDCL

CDCL starts out very similarly to DPLL in that it still features unit
propagation and pure literal elimination. However it also involves additional
bookkeeping, distinguishing between decisions (when we choose a truth value for
a variable) and implications (truth values determined through unit propagation
and pure literal elimination). It also keeps track of the [implication
graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implication_graph) created by decisions
and implications.

Let's look at a more complex example.

$$\begin{align}
& (a \vee d) \wedge \\
& (a \vee \neg c \vee \neg f) \wedge \\
& (a \vee f \vee j) \wedge \\
& (b \vee i) \wedge \\
& (\neg e \vee \neg c \vee g) \wedge \\
& (\neg e \vee f \vee \neg g) \wedge \\
& (e \vee f \vee \neg h) \wedge \\
& (e \vee h \vee \neg j)
\end{align}$$

We start by setting $a$ to $False$, which implies $d$ through the clause $a \vee d$.

<div style="display: flex">
<div style="flex: 33%"><img src="/images/tree1x1.svg"></div>
<div style="flex: 33%"><img src="/images/graph1x1.svg"></div>
<div style="flex: 33%">
$$\begin{align}
& {\color{red} a} \vee {\color{green} d} \\
& {\color{red} a} \vee \neg c \vee \neg f \\
& {\color{red} a} \vee f \vee j \\
& b \vee i \\
& \neg e \vee \neg c \vee g \\
& \neg e \vee f \vee \neg g \\
& e \vee f \vee \neg h \\
& e \vee h \vee \neg j
\end{align}$$
</div>
</div>


Next we set $c$ to $True$, which implies $\neg f$ through the clause $a \vee
\neg c \vee \neg f$ and $j$ through the clause $a \vee f \vee j$.

<div style="display: flex">
<div style="flex: 33%"><img src="/images/tree1x3.svg"></div>
<div style="flex: 33%"><img src="/images/graph1x3.svg"></div>
<div style="flex: 33%">
$$\begin{align}
& {\color{red} a} \vee {\color{green} d} \\
& {\color{red} a} \vee {\color{red}\neg c} \vee {\color{green} \neg f} \\
& {\color{red} a} \vee {\color{red} f} \vee {\color{green} j} \\
& b \vee i \\
& \neg e \vee {\color{red}\neg c} \vee g \\
& \neg e \vee {\color{red} f} \vee \neg g \\
& e \vee {\color{red} f} \vee \neg h \\
& e \vee h \vee {\color{red}\neg j}
\end{align}$$
</div>
</div>

We continue by setting $b$ to $False$, which implies $i$ through the clause $b
\vee i$.

<div style="display: flex">
<div style="flex: 33%"><img src="/images/tree1x2.svg"></div>
<div style="flex: 33%"><img src="/images/graph1x2.svg"></div>
<div style="flex: 33%">
$$\begin{align}
& {\color{red} a} \vee {\color{green} d} \\
& {\color{red} a} \vee {\color{red}\neg c} \vee {\color{green} \neg f} \\
& {\color{red} a} \vee {\color{red} f} \vee {\color{green} j} \\
& {\color{red} b} \vee {\color{green} i} \\
& \neg e \vee {\color{red}\neg c} \vee g \\
& \neg e \vee {\color{red} f} \vee \neg g \\
& e \vee {\color{red} f} \vee \neg h \\
& e \vee h \vee {\color{red}\neg j}
\end{align}$$
</div>
</div>

Then we set $e$ to $True$, which causes a conflict because $g$ is implied to be
both $True$ (through the clause $\neg e \vee \neg c \vee g$) and $False$
(through the clause $\neg e \vee f \vee \neg g$).

<div style="display: flex">
<div style="flex: 33%"><img src="/images/tree1.svg"></div>
<div style="flex: 33%"><img src="/images/graph1.svg"></div>
<div style="flex: 33%">
$$\begin{align}
& {\color{red} a} \vee {\color{green} d} \\
& {\color{red} a} \vee {\color{red}\neg c} \vee {\color{green} \neg f} \\
& {\color{red} a} \vee {\color{red} f} \vee {\color{green} j} \\
& {\color{red} b} \vee {\color{green} i} \\
& {\color{red}\neg e} \vee {\color{red}\neg c} \vee {\color{blue} g} \\
& {\color{red}\neg e} \vee {\color{red} f} \vee {\color{blue}\neg g} \\
& {\color{green} e} \vee {\color{red} f} \vee \neg h \\
& {\color{green} e} \vee h \vee {\color{red}\neg j}
\end{align}$$
</div>
</div>

## Clause learning

Fortunately we can analyse the implication graph to determine a [Unique
Implication
Point](https://users.aalto.fi/~tjunttil/2020-DP-AUT/notes-sat/cdcl.html#implication-graphs-learned-clauses-and-backjumping)
that all edges from the latest decision node to the conflict node pass through,
and the corresponding *UIP cut* corresponding to a clause. In this case the
UIP is the decision node $e$ and the clause is $\neg f \vee c \vee e$. We want
to remove the possibility of reaching this state again, so we negate this
clause (by De Morgan's theorem).

<div style="display: flex">
<div style="flex: 50%"><img src="/images/graph2.svg"></div>
<div style="flex: 50%">
$$\displaylines{\neg (\neg f \wedge c \wedge e) \\
\iff \\
(f \vee \neg c \vee \neg e)}$$
</div>
</div>

And this gives us our *learned clause*!

$$(f \vee \neg c \vee \neg e)$$

We can then add it to our formula.

$$\begin{align}
\definecolor{comment}{RGB}{161,161,180}
\definecolor{emphasis}{RGB}{88,110,117}
& {\color{comment}(a \vee d) \wedge} \\
& {\color{comment}(a \vee \neg c \vee \neg f) \wedge} \\
& {\color{comment}(a \vee f \vee j) \wedge} \\
& {\color{comment}(b \vee i) \wedge} \\
& {\color{comment}(\neg e \vee \neg c \vee g) \wedge} \\
& {\color{comment}(\neg e \vee f \vee \neg g) \wedge} \\
& {\color{comment}(e \vee f \vee \neg h) \wedge} \\
& {\color{comment}(e \vee h \vee \neg j) \wedge} \\\
& (f \vee \neg c \vee \neg e)
\end{align}$$

## Non-chronological backjumping

Next we *backjump non-chronologically* to the second-highest decision level of
the literals in our clause, which in this case is $2$, and repeat.

<img src="/images/tree2.svg">

That's CDCL (Conflict-driven clause learning)!

## Conflict-driven Clause Learning

Conflict-driven clause learning is an extension of DPLL with learned clauses
and non-chronological backtracking, effectively addressing most of DPLL's
downsides. It forms the basis of most modern SAT solvers.

# SLS

In contrast to the rigorous and structured approaches we've seen already, what
if we tried something more ad-hoc? We could generate a random assignment of
$True$ and $False$ values for each of our variables, pick a clause at random,
and flip either the "best" variable (whose negation causes the fewest
conflicts) or some other variable. We could loop this selection and flipping
a number of times, and restart the whole assignment upon getting stuck,
finishing after either finding a solution or after a predetermined number of
tries.

## Stochastic Local Search

This is known as stochastic local search and it's surprisingly effective! The
specific algorithm I described above is called
[WalkSAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WalkSAT) and it's possible to [do it in
parallel and use a form of clause
learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/research/dap-papers/dap_mcdonald.pdf).
Unfortunately, this approach cannot conclusively determine unsatisfiability
because an inconclusive result might be due to the solver running out of
attempts. A more general technique that this family of algorithms reminds me of
is called [simulated
annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing).

# SMT

SAT solvers are great when it's straightforward to express your problem as
a boolean satisfiability problem, but what if we want to solve more complex
problems where we might not have the ability or desire to do so?

$$
\begin{align}
  SEND &\\
+ MORE &\\
\hline
MONEY
\end{align}
$$

To solve this puzzle, we need to assign digit values to each of the letters
such that the sum of the 4-digit number represented by $SEND$ and the 4-digit
number represented by $MORE$ equals the 5-digit number $MONEY$.

We'd have to essentially teach our SAT solver how to do enough arithmetic for
it to solve the equation

$$
\begin{align}
  (1000 \cdot (S+M)) + (100 \cdot (E+O)) + (10 \cdot (N+R)) + (D+E) &\\
= (10000 \cdot M) + (1000 \cdot O) + (100 \cdot N) + (10 \cdot E) + Y
\end{align}
$$

## Satisfiability Modulo Theories

This is what an SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solver is! A SAT solver
can be extended to reason over bitvectors, fixed-length arrays, Presburger
arithmetic, algebraic datatypes, and more. One way of doing this would be to
pre-process a problem into a series of CNF clauses that can be fed to a normal
SAT solver; this is known as
[bit-blasting](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15414/s23/lectures/21-bitblasting.pdf),
but deeper integrations are often more practical. Examples of SMT solvers
include [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3), [CVC5](https://cvc5.github.io/),
[Yices](https://yices.csl.sri.com/), and
[Bitwuzla](https://bitwuzla.github.io/).

# That's all!

I hope you have a basic understanding of what a SAT/SMT solver is, how they
(broadly) work, and when it might be a good idea to use them!
