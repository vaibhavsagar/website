title: Industrial-strength Deployments in Three Commands

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If your deployment target is running NixOS, a full-system deployment is only
three commands:

```bash
$ nix-copy-closure --to --use-substitutes <target> <path>                                #1
$ ssh <target> -- "sudo nix-env --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/system --set <path>"     #2
$ ssh <target> -- "sudo /nix/var/nix/profiles/system/bin/switch-to-configuration switch" #3
```

Here's what each command does:

1. Copies the transitive closure of the new system configuration to the target,
   using binary caches (`--use-substitutes`) where possible.
2. Sets the current system profile to the new system configuration. This isn't
   strictly necessary, but allows us to roll back to this configuration later.
3. Switches to the new system configuration.

This workflow has been described before [in
Typeclasses](https://typeclasses.com/nixos-on-aws) and [by Gabriella
Gonzalez](http://www.haskellforall.com/2018/08/nixos-in-production.html), but I
thought one more post demonstrating how to use these commands wouldn't hurt.
Since the AWS use case has been covered so thoroughly by Typeclasses, I'm going
to use the [packet.net](https://www.packet.com/) cloud instead.

#### Provisioning

I logged on to the Packet console and launched a `t1.small.x86` instance
running NixOS 19.03 (the latest as of this writing). It was assigned the IP
address `147.75.38.113`. Since I added my SSH keys when I first created my
Packet account, I was able to SSH into this instance at `root@147.75.38.113`
without any further configuration.

#### Copying the existing configuration

The next step is to copy the existing configuration, especially
instance-specific hardware configuration:

```bash
$ scp -r root@147.75.38.113:/etc/nixos/* .
```

There's probably a better way to do this, but for a quick one-off demonstration
this is fine. [Here's the commit adding those
files](https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/nixos-config/commit/e49e9a980f2d547684bcab3a34a34dba4521b991).

We'll only be making changes to `configuration.nix`, which for me looks like
this (after all commented-out lines have been removed):

```nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }:

{
  imports =
    [
      ./packet.nix
    ];

  boot.loader.grub.enable = true;
  boot.loader.grub.version = 2;

  system.stateVersion = "19.03";

}
```

#### Building a system closure

The Nix expression to build a whole system is pretty straightforward (as
described in the Typeclasses article):

```nix
let
  nixos = import <nixpkgs/nixos> {
    configuration = import ./configuration.nix;
  };
in
  nixos.system
```

but this doesn't provide any way of pinning `nixpkgs`. Another way ([as
described by Gabriella
Gonzalez](http://www.haskellforall.com/2018/08/nixos-in-production.html#pinning-nixpkgs)),
is to explicitly depend on a particular revision of `nixpkgs`:

```nix
let
  nixpkgs = builtins.fetchTarball {
    url = "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/b74b1cdb2fecc31ff7a127c5bc89771f887c93bb.tar.gz";
    sha256 = "0ncr4g29220amqm4riaa1xf4jz55v2nmh9fi16f1gzhww1gplk8h";
  };

in
  import "${nixpkgs}/nixos" {
    configuration = {
      imports = [
        /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
      ];
    };

    system = "x86_64-linux";
  }
```

but the downside there is that there's no automated way to update the revision
of `nixpkgs`. I have [my own approach to pinning
`nixpkgs`](/blog/2018/05/27/quick-easy-nixpkgs-pinning/),
where I have a `versions.json` that stores version information:

```json
{
  "nixpkgs": {
    "owner": "NixOS",
    "repo": "nixpkgs-channels",
    "branch": "nixos-19.03",
    "rev": "77295b0bd26555c39a1ba9c1da72dbdb651fd280",
    "sha256": "18v866h12xk6l1s37nk1vns869pvzphmnnlhrnm2b1zklg2hd1nq"
  }
}
```

and a script that uses `jq` to update this file. My (slightly more complex)
expression then looks like this:


*default.nix*
```nix
let
  fetcher = { owner, repo, rev, sha256, ... }: builtins.fetchTarball {
    inherit sha256;
    url = "https://github.com/${owner}/${repo}/tarball/${rev}";
  };
  nixpkgs = fetcher (builtins.fromJSON (builtins.readFile ./versions.json)).nixpkgs;
  nixos = import "${nixpkgs}/nixos" {
    configuration = import ./configuration.nix;
  };
in
  nixos.system
```

and this allows me to both be explicit about `nixpkgs` as well as easily update it
when necessary. [Here's the commit that adds those
files](https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/nixos-config/commit/5126d9dba971d6480aeec43c4263c5a7f7b1f1b5).

Building the closure locally is also straightforward (as described [here](https://typeclasses.com/nixos-on-aws#building-nixos-locally)):

```bash
$ nix-build --no-out-link default.nix
```

#### Deploying the system closure

With all of our prerequisites taken care of, deploying the system closure is straightforward:


*deploy.sh*
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euxo pipefail

TARGET="root@147.75.38.113"

PROFILE_PATH="$(nix-build --no-out-link default.nix)"
nix-copy-closure --to --use-substitutes $TARGET $PROFILE_PATH
ssh $TARGET -- "nix-env --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/system --set $PROFILE_PATH && /nix/var/nix/profiles/system/bin/switch-to-configuration switch"
```

This takes care of both building the new system closure and deploying it.

[Here's the commit that adds `deploy.sh`](https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/nixos-config/commit/be6aaa026c8ebf1efd7c44743a8770b921111a2e).

#### Adding a service

Let's deploy the final version of the small Haskell web service from my
[Functional
DevOps](/blog/2019/07/04/functional-devops/) post. The
application consists of two files:

*Main.hs*
```haskell
 {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Web.Scotty
import System.Environment (getArgs)

import Data.Monoid (mconcat)

main = getArgs >>= \(port:_) -> scotty (read port) $ do
    get "/:word" $ do
        beam <- param "word"
        html $ mconcat ["<h1>Scotty, ", beam, " me up!</h1>"]
```

*blank-me-up.cabal*
```default
name:                blank-me-up
version:             0.1.0.0
license:             BSD3
build-type:          Simple
cabal-version:       >=1.10

executable blank-me-up
  main-is:             Main.hs
  build-depends:       base >=4.9 && <5
                     , scotty
  default-language:    Haskell2010
```

and the Nix service is one file:

*service.nix*
```nix
{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:

let
  blank-me-up = pkgs.haskellPackages.callCabal2nix "blank-me-up" ../app {};
  cfg = config.services.blank-me-up;
in {
  options.services.blank-me-up.enable = lib.mkEnableOption "Blank Me Up";
  options.services.blank-me-up.port = lib.mkOption {
    default = 3000;
    type = lib.types.int;
  };

  config = lib.mkIf cfg.enable {
    networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ cfg.port ];

    systemd.services.blank-me-up = {
      description = "Blank Me Up";
      after = [ "network.target" ];
      wantedBy = [ "multi-user.target" ];
      serviceConfig = {
        ExecStart = "${blank-me-up}/bin/blank-me-up ${toString cfg.port}";
        Restart = "always";
        KillMode = "process";
      };
    };
  };
}
```

For more information about what's happening in `service.nix`, see [the relevant
section of my Functional DevOps
post](/blog/2019/07/04/functional-devops/#service-configuration).

[Here's the commit that adds these
files](https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/nixos-config/commit/466e0e1867e47346ed8cc706b812a8cb21c76c19).

Enabling the service is as easy as adding two lines to `configuration.nix`:

*configuration.nix*
```nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }:

{
  imports =
    [
      ./packet.nix
      ./deploy/nix/service.nix        #1
    ];

  boot.loader.grub.enable = true;
  boot.loader.grub.version = 2;

  services.blank-me-up.enable = true; #2

  system.stateVersion = "19.03";

}

```

[Here's the commit that makes that change](https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/nixos-config/commit/07b163f3c0fe728078bb357841e57c7020bdd4d3).

#### Deploying the service

```bash

#### But this is just a janky bash script!!???

It's definitely the case that `deploy.sh` is short and unsophisticated, but the
three commands it invokes are what's really important here. Once you begin
looking for them, you will find them everywhere, since they're the best way of
deploying to NixOS! They're used in
[NixOps](https://github.com/NixOS/nixops/blob/c8d3a3ff5fb20e8e4d494de972ebb2a1a1ec1e08/nixops/backends/__init__.py#L339-L367),
[nix-deploy](https://github.com/awakesecurity/nix-deploy/blob/68217cea7ba6746c9a262ddccb11178909841988/src/Main.hs#L159-L229),
and
[obelisk](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk/blob/1f9f466fc38a37a72afb316cee4f3317af204220/lib/command/src/Obelisk/Command/Deploy.hs#L136-L158),
and a quick GitHub search for
["switch-to-configuration"](https://github.com/search?q=switch-to-configuration&type=Code)
turns up many more examples. At a previous job, our deployment platform used
these three commands as well, and we routinely deployed to hundreds of servers
without any deployment-related issues, so I'm comfortable saying that this is
an industrial-grade deployment solution.

#### What about provisioning?

These tools don't care how you provision your servers, as long as you end up
with NixOS targets you can SSH into. For quick demonstrations and small
deployments, manual provisioning is fine, but for anything beyond that, I'd
recommend using a tool like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). You can
even specify your Terraform configuration with Nix using something like
[terranix](https://github.com/mrVanDalo/terranix), and this is in fact what we
did at the previous job I mentioned earlier, since Nix makes a great templating
language and comes with excellent support for producing JSON which can then be
fed into Terraform. It's also possible to output YAML from Nix, which means
it's easy to interoperate with most infrastructure tooling.

#### Should I use this instead of my current deployment solution?

My aim with this post is not to convince you to drop whatever you're currently
using in favour of a hand-rolled bash script and NixOS, especially if your
current solution works well for you. I do, however, want to encourage you to
think about how the process I've outlined here compares. In which ways is it
better or worse?

Since this is the workflow I've had the most experience with, it was a rude
shock to start working with container-based deployments where even tiny changes
require a full (slow) rebuild, and the actual deployment lifecycle is more
complex and error-prone. I think it's important to point out that things don't
have to be this way.

In my [Functional
DevOps](/blog/2019/07/04/functional-devops/) post, I
outlined some characteristics of an ideal DevOps workflow, and I think the
process I've outlined here meets them all:

- **Automatic**: The process is completely scriptable.
- **Repeatable**: I can leverage NixOS to get the same results every time.
- **Idempotent**: Deploying the same thing a second time is a no-op.
- **Reversible**: Rolling back is very easy.
- **Atomic**: A deploy either fails or succeeds, there's no weird in-between[^1].

I think this is pretty great for three commands. I hope this blog post can help
move us towards better systems by making this corner of NixOS more
approachable!

[^1]: As [ElvishJerricco points out on
  Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/ctx8ii/industrialstrength_deployments_in_three_commands/expfqpv),
  this isn't quite true in the case of broken services.
